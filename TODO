 * create the plotter (but keep it hidden) when an interface
   gets connected, so that we have sort of memory for the plotter
 * include an option: "show as line" - like the signal plotter in kppp
 * another option: "show up/down speed" in the bottom right (those numbers 
   shown in tooltip)
 * add a button for context menu entries presets. I mean it would be great 
   if newbies could select entries for kppp, network start/stop/restart
 * show two dynamic bars with the current netload instead of an icon 
 * It would also be great if the color of the animation tray icon will reflect the current bandwidth... For example gray for 0-25%, light green 25-50% green 50-75%, red 75-100%. (The simplest way to achieve this is to have 14 icons for each set. Or N icons and allow the user to select a bandwith range and appropriate icon.)
