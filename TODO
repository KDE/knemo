 * redesign the status dialog
 * add MAC address of access point to WLAN infos
 * create the plotter (but keep it hidden) when an interface
   gets connected, so that we have sort of memory for the plotter
 * more usefull WLAN infos (remove signal/noise and display signal strength
   as an absolut value in percent)
 * include an option: "show as line" - like the signal plotter in kppp
 * another option: "show up/down speed" in the bottom right (those numbers 
   shown in tooltip)
 * add a button for context menu entries presets. I mean it would be great 
   if newbies could select entries for kppp, network start/stop/restart
 * show two dynamic bars with the current netload instead of an icon
