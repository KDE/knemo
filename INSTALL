To build KNemo you will need a basic build system (g++, make, etc.)  You will
also need to install cmake and selected Qt4 and KDE4 development packages. On
Debian-based systems
   apt-get install build-essential kdebase-workspace-dev net-tools \
       wireless-tools libiw-dev
should be sufficient.

KNemo also comes with a simple configure script that should work for a generic
local install.  If it doesn't suit your needs, you will need to edit the cmake
settings by hand.

Quick installation steps:
    ./configure
    cd build; make; make install

Cmake's equivalent to 'make distclean' is 'rm -rf build'.
