To build KNemo you will need a basic build system (g++, make, etc.)  You will
also need to install cmake and selected Qt4 and KDE4 development packages. On
Debian-based systems
   apt-get install build-essential kdebase-workspace-dev net-tools \
       wireless-tools libiw-dev
should be sufficient.

KNemo also comes with a simple configure script that should work for a generic
local install.  If it doesn't suit your needs, you will need to edit the cmake
settings by hand.

Quick installation steps:
    ./configure
    cd build; make; make install

Cmake's equivalent to 'make distclean' is 'rm -rf build'.


Notes:

By default, KNemo uses the older KSystemTrayIcon because it behaves well on
desktops like GNOME or Xfce.  If you are only using this on a KDE desktop, you
might want to run configure with the '-n' option.  This will use the shiny new
KStatusNotifierItem.

If you cannot open the KNemo config dialog after you install, you probably need
to modify your environment.  Assuming you installed KNemo in /usr/local, add
something like this to your .profile

    export KDEDIRS=/usr/local:/usr

Then restart your session.
