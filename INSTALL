To build KNemo you will need a basic build system (g++, make, etc.)  You will
also need to install cmake and some development packages. On Debian-based
systems
   apt-get install cmake kdelibs5-dev libiw-dev libnl-3-dev libnl-route-3-dev
should be sufficient.


Notes:

KNemo saves statistics in an SQLite 3 database.  It will complain loudly if it
cannot find Qt4's SQLite 3 database driver.

If you cannot open the KNemo config dialog after you install, you probably need
to modify your environment.  Assuming you installed KNemo in /usr/local, add
something like this to your .profile

    export KDEDIRS=/usr/local:/usr

Then restart your session.
