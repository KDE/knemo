To build KNemo you will need a basic build system (g++, make, etc.)  You will
also need to install cmake and some KDE4 development packages. On Debian-based
systems
   apt-get install cmake kdelibs5-dev libiw-dev libnl-dev
should be sufficient.

KNemo also comes with a simple configure script that should work for a generic
local install.  If it doesn't suit your needs, you will need to edit the cmake
settings by hand.

Quick installation steps:
    ./configure
    cd build; make; make install

Cmake's equivalent to 'make distclean' is 'rm -rf build'.


Notes:

By default, KNemo uses the new KStatusNotifierItem if it is compiled against
KDE >= 4.3.80.  If you wish to use the older KSystemTrayIcon, either set the
cmake variable LEGACY_TRAY_ICON=true or run configure with the '-l' option.

If you cannot open the KNemo config dialog after you install, you probably need
to modify your environment.  Assuming you installed KNemo in /usr/local, add
something like this to your .profile

    export KDEDIRS=/usr/local:/usr

Then restart your session.
