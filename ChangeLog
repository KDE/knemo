Version 0.4.6:
 * disable statistics entries in configuration dialog if statistics are
   not activated for at least one interface
 * sys backend uses ioctls for network addresses
 * sys backend uses proc filesystem for default gateway
 * sys backend uses iwlib for wireless information
 * wireless tab of status dialog was redesigned
 * improved switching of status dialog and signal plotter
 * if the PPP driver resets its data on disconnection KNemo should
   also start to count the data from zero for every new connection

Version 0.4.5:
 * fixed counting of transmitted data for sys backend
 * changed handling of KNemo as a service:
   KNemo must now be started using its control center module. This was
   necessary to keep KNemo from starting automatically for every user
   in a multiuser environment.
 * fixed calculation of transfer speed
 * redesigned the status dialog

Version 0.4.4:
 * fixed counting of transfered data for ppp interfaces

Version 0.4.3:
 * updated Russian translation
 * support for different backends to gather information

Version 0.4.2:
 * fixed crash when opening status dialog or tooltips

Version 0.4.1:
 * added Hungarian translation
 * updated Russian translation
 * added timer to store statistics periodically
 * made location of statistic files configurable
 * made update interval of interface informations configurable

Version 0.4.0 (april fool release):
 * added statistics for every day, month and year that show the
   incoming, outgoing and total traffic.
 * some minor improvements and changes

Version 0.3.1 (birthday release):
 * added Russian translation
 * updated Brazilian Portuguese translation
 * updated French translation
 * it's possible to move the custom menu entries up and down
 * added preview for iconsets
 * if visible but not on top RMB and MMB will bring traffic plotter to front
   instead of hiding it
 * same for LMB and status dialog
 * status dialog and traffic plotter store their position and size in the
   config file so that they keep them between 2 KDE sessions
 
Version 0.3.0:
 * updated Czech translation
 * updated Italian translation
 * added support for dynamic number of entries in the context menu. Useful
   to start/stop/restart interfaces or to configure them using external tools 
   like KNetworkConf or NetGo.

Version 0.2.3 (the illuminated release)
 * updated Czech translation
 * updated German translation
 * updated Brazilian Portuguese translation
 * updated Spanish translation
 * updated French translation
 * KNemo now supports iconsets. This is the same behaviour as the previous 
   'indication of connection type'. This checkbox was removed and an entry
   'Monitors' added to the combobox. The monitors are still default but now 
   you can select a different set of icons for every interface.
   Thanks to SarahB for this proposal.

Version 0.2.2 (maintenance release):
 * added Dutch translation
 * updated Italian translation
 * updated Brazilian Portuguese translation
 * the system tray icon can indicate the connection type
   drawback: you need to tell KNemo the type of connection as KNemo can
   only detect the type when the interface is connected. So offline
   interfaces would display the wrong icon. Automatic detection of the 
   connection type will be turned off if the user sets it manually.
 * traffic plotter now also accessible through context menu
 * status dialog and traffic plotter store their position on the screen
   between closing and reopening

Version 0.2.1 (maintenance release):
 * added French translation
 * added Brazilian Portuguese translation
 * updated Czech translation
 * added KNemo application icon ( Danke Bernd ;-) )
 * show correct uptime in the tooltip

Version 0.2.0:
 * added Italian translation
 * added Czech translation
 * fixed: selecting a different interface in the configuration dialog activated 
   the 'Apply' button
 * fixed the 4GB bug: Knemo reported 4GB of sent and received traffic
   shortly after the connection was established
 * added status information for ethernet interfaces: broadcast address
   and default gateway
 * added traffic information: transfer speed for up- and download
 * added notification for 'interface does not exist'
 * status dialog: made all labels on the IP-tab selectable making it possible
   to copy&paste the information on this tab 
 * middle-clicking on an icon displays a traffic plotter that was taken 
   from KSysGuard (2nd click hides dialog)

Version 0.1.10 (maintenance release):
 * removed the entry 'Quit' in the context menu as it shouldn't be used
   for daemons (moreover it doesn't work for them correctly)
 * fixed the German translation
 * updated Bulgarian and Spanish translation
 * fixed a compile problem with KDE-CVS
 * improved configure check of 'ifconfig' and 'iwconfig'
 * don't display empty line in tooltip if no alias is set
 * small fix for Bit Rate detection of wireless interfaces

Version 0.1.9:
 * fixed recognition of connection status for interfaces that are IPv6 enabled
 * don't compile and install documentation as long as there is none
 * added GPL header in all source files
 * added Bulgarian translations by Malin Malinov <lgmim@club-35.com>
 * ESSIDs can now contain any character
 * KNemo counts the number of transfered bytes and no longer depends on the
   output of 'ifconfig' for the total number of transfered bytes. This way 
   KNemo can even display a hugh amount of traffic while 'ifconfig' has an
   overflow at 4GB.
 * added "About KNemo" dialog
 * added "Report Bug" entry in context menu
 * KNemo now distinguishs between the interface not being connected and
   the interface not existing. Added an option to hide the icon when the
   interface does not exist. This is useful for interfaces that are dynamically
   created and destroyed, for example interfaces of bluetooth adapters.
 * tooltips don't display uptime and wireless information when not connected
   or the interface does not exist
 * statusdialog uses correct icon and displays the interface name in the
   title to avoid <2> etc in the title when opening more than one dialog
 * 'ifconfig' and 'iwconfig' are now called with LANG and LC_ALL set to C
   to avoid problems with localized output
 * configure will now search for 'ifconfig' and 'iwconfig' so it is no
   longer neccessary to setup the path in the config dialog

Version 0.1.8:
 * fixed a bug with localized output of 'ifconfig' (parsing of received
   and send packets)
 * fixed a bug with uptime using QDateTime::daysTo() which doesn't
   give the correct results when you are interessted in complete days
 * added support for notifications
 * started with localization

Version 0.1.7
 * custom tooltips: the tooltips can now be configured to show some (or all)
   of the information available in the status dialog. This is meant for easy
   and quick access to often needed information.
 * opening the control center module from the context menu will preselect
   the interface the context menu belongs to
 * fixed handling of 'Reset' in the control center

Version 0.1.6
 * left-clicking an icon toggles the status dialog
 * 2 optional custom entries in the context menu to start and stop the
   interface
 * using the more standard icons
   - network_disconnected
   - network_connected
   - network_incoming
   - network_outgoing
   - network_traffic
 * install the icons under $KDEDIR/share/icons/crystalsvg/22x22/actions
 * fixed a problem with QTime when uptime became negative after midnight

Version 0.1.5
 * Initial Release
